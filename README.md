### V-Lance Recommender for Virtual Leader

### Description:
  The project titled “V-Lance Recommender for Virtual Leader” provides a platform where individuals can post their   projects and find relevant people who can help them complete these projects. The platform recommends projects to   the existing users based on their industry experience, job function, MBTI type and skills they have. 


### User flow:
  -	An individual can post a prompt that includes project details. A description is given about the project and        the tasks involved to complete the project.
  -	Next the user also provides a deadline for the project completion.
  -	The matching algorithm matches the project requirements with the available user data. The matching is done         based on their industry experience, job function, MBTI type and skills. 
  -	Scores are calculated with each individual user and the top five scorers are considered and the project is         recommended to them.
  -	Next these 5 users are asked to provide the time in which they can complete the project. The project is            assigned to the user who guarantees to complete the project in the lowest amount of time.
  -	Moreover, multiple projects can be entered once and hence prioritisation is used to prioritise the projects.
