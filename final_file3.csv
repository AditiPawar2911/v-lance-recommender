My roles have varied from Associate Manager to Senior Director and Head of Discovery Research during this time.

My main expertise lies in drug discovery, and I have led a team in the development of numerous novel biologic molecules for therapy. One of our successful development is Nimotuzumab (Anti EGFR mAb), which is widely used for treating Head and Neck cancer in India and several other regions around the world.

Additionally, I played a key role, including as program lead, in the development of Itolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD6 with proven clinical efficacy in treating psoriasis. It is currently undergoing early and late-stage clinical trials in Lupus nephritis and acute Graft vs Host Disease with our partners Equillium in the United States of America.

Another significant project I was involved in is the development of BCA101, a bifunctional molecule targeting EGFR overexpressing tumors and sequestering TGF beta in the tumor microenvironment. This asset has progressed into Phase II clinical studies following successful safety and efficacy assessments in Head and Neck cancers under a US IND. Clinical trials conducted in the US have reported favorable tolerability and efficacy in combination with immune checkpoint therapy.

Presently, I am engaged in the development of a novel bifunctional antibody and cytokine conjugated molecule, BCA356, for Bicara therapeutics. This novel fusion molecule targets the tumor specific antigen CAIX via a high affinity mAb and incorporates an attenuated IL-12 fused to its C terminal domain at its cytoplasmic tail.

My skill set includes bioassay development, Flow cytometry, Biostatistics, in vivo and in vitro pharmacology, immunology, and translational research including biomarker analysis. I have also led teams in developing bioanalytical methods, including PK, ADA, and neutralizing assays for both toxicology studies and human clinical trials. In addition to the development of novel biologics, I have actively contributed to the development of bioassays and bioanalytical methods to support the biosimilar program at Biocon for trastuzumab, PEG-filgrastim, and Avastin.",,,INTJ,"HR Compliance, Sustainability Management, Brand Strategy, SEO, Eco-Friendly Design, Climate Change Awareness, Green Energy Solutions"

As a proud alumnus of the prestigious MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX, USA, I bring to the table a wealth of multifaceted experience fortified by an intricate understanding of the tumor microenvironment and the complex cross-talk between the cancer cells and the host immune response. This foundational grasp of cancer biology has been pivotal in my pursuit of devising innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. 

I've made significant strides in developing a novel approach of combining autologous CAR-T cells with allogeneic Treg cells (causes global immunosuppression) for managing CAR-T cell therapy-associated immune-related adverse events such as cytokine release syndrome (calming the overactive immune system). 

I am also actively working on AI-enabled drug discovery projects using the latest advances in Targeted Protein Degradation (TPD) landscape for targeting key proteins in the Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) Pathway. 

My dream project is to work on Neoantigen mRNA cancer vaccines for solid tumors.
